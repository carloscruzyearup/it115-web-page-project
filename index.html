			<h1 class="display-4 text-center btn-outline-success">Hawaii's smart city</h1>
			<p>
				Hawaii ranks as one of the greatest places to live in. Many people associate Hawaii with gorgeous
				landscapes, pleasant weather, friendly people, and a variety of cultural and recreational activities.
				But there are some impacts that make Hawaii a hard place to live especially the social problems. Here
				are some of them:</p>

			<p>
			<h2 class="display btn-outline-secondary">Racism</h2>

			There is a tension that can exist between locals and some visitors that take Hawaii for granted and that
			don’t treat others with respect. Locals will put you in your place in some cases… and it’s not a reason
			to not move to the islands – it’s just something to be aware of.</p>

			<p>
			<h3 class="display btn-outline-warning">Traffic</h3>

			Roads in Hawaii were not designed with the intention of having to expand in width for whatever reason.
			Because buildings are already too near to the roadway, there is little room to widen most routes in
			town. There isn't any available room. Contraflow lanes, high occupancy vehicle lanes (1+ persons in the
			car), coordinated stoplights, and improved public transportation, such as TheBus, are just a few of the
			programs in place by the state to help with traffic flow.</p>
			<p>
			<h4 class="display btn-outline-primary">TOO MANY POLICE WORRIED ABOUT SEAT BELT ENFORCEMENT</h4>

			If you are late put your seatbelt on – they are there standing in the middle of the street looking for
			people that put on their seatbelts late! If you coast through a stop sign – even slightly – they’re on
			you. If you speed – they got ya! If you ride in the wrong lane on the highway – you’re toast. It seems
			that you cannot win driving a vehicle on the islands. This in particular was no fun for me at all. As I
			said, I used the bike or walked a lot while living on the islands.</p>

			<p>
			<h5 class="display btn-outline-danger">HOMELESSNESS – A MAJOR SOCIAL PROBLEM IN HAWAII</h5>

			Like everywhere in the U.S. there are homeless people living in Hawaii. Some are happy to be homeless,
			and some are not – but, they are here and increasing in numbers. In 2019, there were an estimated 9.4%
			of the state’s population lived below the poverty level. With regards to the number of people living on
			the street, there are an estimated 4,400 homeless individuals on O’ahu as of January 2020. Homeless
			folks live at the beach, on the west side of Oahu near Kaena Point, in the parks, on the streets, under
			highways, and even underneath Hawaiian School's portable facilities. Some have cars, and you might see a
			whole family loving in one. Small tent cities pop up from one place to another, and various plans for a
			large tent city have been introduced over the years – but are usually shot down by neighboring
			communities afraid crime will increase in their neighborhood. </p>
