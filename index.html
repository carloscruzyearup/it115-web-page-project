						In his article, Abino (et. al) states that “many definitions of smart cities exist” (Abino et al, 2015, pg. 4). These definitions are shaped by the many factors contributing to and determining what constitutes a “smart city”. Hence, there are several components of a smart city. This fact is alluded to in both articles, in which the authors list the same contributing factors, but designate them into different classifications. In Nam and Pardo’s article, they “identify and clarify key conceptual components of smart city, and re-categorize and simplify them into three categories of core factors: technology (infrastructures of hardware and software), people (creativity, diversity, and education), and institution (governance and policy)” (Nam & Pardo, pg. 286). The stark increase in use of modern technology that continues to quickly advance has advanced our own societies and evolution as human beings. In the present day, cities around the world are developing in ways that make civilization more dependent on technology to enhance quality of life.

				<h3 class="display-4">Songdo's Smart City</h3>
				<p>The city of Songdo in South Korea  is a prime example of what a “smart city” looks like and how it greatly affects its people. 
					One way of analyzing smart cities is considering “smart” decision making when it comes to city planning and development.
					But how do we make these decisions? With the growth in technology, urban planners and designers have a more efficient way of retrieving data. 
					Decision making based on big data can be beneficial because it focuses primarily on mass data collection which may have useful ramifications for civilization. 
					We are able to retrieve data from camera footage and sensors that are placed in various ways and places-- for different purposes-- throughout the city. 
					As such, not only can we use these sensors as a way of retrieving data, but these sensors can serve other purposes and do things such as help control and eliminate traffic. 
					This notion is reflected how one of the core mechanisms in a smart city is a self-monitoring and self-response system. </p>

				<h3 class="display-4">San Francisco's Smart City</h3>
					<p>

						As beneficial as smart cities can be, there are some negative aspects to smart cities that can be seen through an example of another smart city, San Francisco. 
						San Francisco has been an integral part of the tech hub within Silicon Valley, boasting 3 out of 4 FAANG companies, Meta (Facebook), Apple, Netflix, and Google, residing in this area.
						San Francisco's success is partially due to the city being the top tech investment hub worldwide. 
						San Francisco also holds the status as the most expensive city to live in the US, as of 2022. In addition to this, the city's average incomes are over $100,000 a year. (Bungalow, 2022) 
					</p>

					<p>

						With San Francisco's reputation and ability to invest into technological advances, the city's government has taken steps into developing into a smart city to fulfill the challenges that have resulted due to their exponential growth. 
						The main challenge that has been focused on, is the lack of affordable housing, as more new-comers arrive to become tech professionals. 
						In addition to the constant population increase within San Francisco, comes the increase in people using cars to commute. 
						Traffic congestion is another main challenge that has been targeted by SF's Smart City Challenge Proposal, which has been connected to the lack of housing, due to the city's extended usage of parking spaces. 
						To address these challenges, San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFTMA), has received an $11 million grant by the U.S Department of Transportation (USDOT), to implement their items within their Smart City Challenge Proposal. 
						In SFTMA's report regarding this proposal (SFTMA, 2018), they state, "Our vision is of shared mobility, i.e., the shared use of a vehicle, public transit, bicycle, or other mode, 
						...Ultimately, we can set the process in motion by prioritizing space for walking, public transit/shared mobility and bicycling, and over time for more community-oriented needs including open space, affordable housing, and city amenities." 

					</p>

					<p>

						As honorable as this objective and vision is, it should be noted that this is a reflection of Smart City's main negative: having government oversight in the development of their city, with the lack of scope as to how it impacts its communities. 
						In one Bloomberg article, "A Smart City Is Rarely Smart Enough to Account for People’s Feelings" (Kushner, 2019), the author takes note of SFTMA prioritizing public transit over the negative impacts that it has on local businesses. 
						SFTMA and the city's government implemented red zoned lanes on Mission Street, specifically to be used for buses, and to improve traffic flow. The merchants and business owners have suffered a decrease in their customers due to the red lanes blocking entry to their shops, and limiting parking spaces. 
						Kushner notes, "Other residents believe the red bus lanes are harbingers of gentrification. They say the improved travel times prioritize the preferences of wealthy new arrivals as well-paid tech industry workers move into the district." 
						The negative impacts on the city's low-income communities and small business-owners must be taken into account as the Smart City initiatives are further developed. If they are not taken into account, the proposal could lead towards further alienation of the city's native communities.
