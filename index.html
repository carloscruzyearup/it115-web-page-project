						In his article, Abino (et. al) states that “many definitions of smart cities exist” (Abino et al, 2015, pg. 4). These definitions are shaped by the many factors contributing to and determining what constitutes a “smart city”. Hence, there are several components of a smart city. This fact is alluded to in both articles, in which the authors list the same contributing factors, but designate them into different classifications. In Nam and Pardo’s article, they “identify and clarify key conceptual components of smart city, and re-categorize and simplify them into three categories of core factors: technology (infrastructures of hardware and software), people (creativity, diversity, and education), and institution (governance and policy)” (Nam & Pardo, pg. 286). The stark increase in use of modern technology that continues to quickly advance has advanced our own societies and evolution as human beings. In the present day, cities around the world are developing in ways that make civilization more dependent on technology to enhance quality of life.

					<h5 class="card-title">Songdo</h5>
					<p class="card-text">The city of Songdo in South Korea  is a prime example of what a “smart city” looks like and how it greatly affects its people. 
						One way of analyzing smart cities is considering “smart” decision making when it comes to city planning and development.
						But how do we make these decisions? With the growth in technology, urban planners and designers have a more efficient way of retrieving data. 
						Decision making based on big data can be beneficial because it focuses primarily on mass data collection which may have useful ramifications for civilization. 
						We are able to retrieve data from camera footage and sensors that are placed in various ways and places-- for different purposes-- throughout the city. 
						As such, not only can we use these sensors as a way of retrieving data, but these sensors can serve other purposes and do things such as help control and eliminate traffic. 
						This notion is reflected how one of the core mechanisms in a smart city is a self-monitoring and self-response system. </p>
